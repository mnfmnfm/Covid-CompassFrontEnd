## About our project
This is the covid-compass app that engages the user to search covid data in different countries or any state in US. It was built to allow users to track covid cases and plan ahead accordingly.

## How this works

- User can clone repo
- cd project and run ```npm i```
- create ```.env``` file
- change value of REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL as per users backend repo setup
